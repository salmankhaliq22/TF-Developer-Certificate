    "## Introduction to Tensorflow in Python - DataCamp - ML-Scientist-Career-Track - by Isaiah Hull\n",
    "___\n",
    "## Chapter 1.1- Constants and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Constants and variables\n",
    "This is a course on the fundamentals of the TensorFlow API in Python. Here, we will briefly introduce TensorFlow and then discuss its two basic objects of computation: **constants** and **variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "TensorFlow is an open-source library for graph-based numerical computation. It was developed by the Google Brain Team. It has both low and high level APIs. You can use TensorFlow to perform addition, multiplication, and differentiation. You can also use it to design and train machine learning models. TensorFlow two point zero brought with it substantial changes. Eager execution is now enabled by default, which allows users to write simpler and more intuitive code. Additionally, model building is now centered around the Keras and Estimators high-level APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is a tensor?\n",
    "The TensorFlow documentation describes a tensor as \"a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions.\" Now, if you are not familiar with linear algebra, you can simply think of a tensor as a collection of numbers, which is arranged into a particular shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is a tensor?\n",
    "As an example, let's say you have a slice of bread and you cut it into 9 pieces. One of those 9 pieces is a 0-dimensional tensor. This corresponds to a single number. A collection of 3 pieces that form a row or column is a 1-dimensional tensor. All 9 pieces together are a 2-dimensional tensor. And the whole loaf, which contains many slices, is a 3-dimensional tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Defining tensors in TensorFlow\n",
    "Now that you know what a tensor is, let's define a few. We will start by importing tensorflow as tf. We will then define 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional tensors. Note that each object will be a tf dot Tensor object."
